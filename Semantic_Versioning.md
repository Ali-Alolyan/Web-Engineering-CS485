# Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

> 1.0.0 => Major.Minor.Patch

## Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of X.Y.Z, where :

- X stands for a major version. The leftmost number denotes a major version. When you increase the major version number, you increase it by one but you reset both patch version and minor versions to zero. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next upgrade for a major version will be 3.0.0. Increase the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Y stands for a minor version. It is used for the release of new functionality in the system. When you increase the minor version, you increase it by one but you must reset the patch version to zero. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next upgrade for a minor version will be 2.7.0. Increase the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Z stands for a Patch Versions: Versions for patches are used for bug fixes. There are no functionality changes in the patch version upgrades. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next version for a patch upgrade will be 2.6.10. There is no limit to these numbers. Increase the value of Z when fixing bugs

* Valid identifiers are in the set [A-Za-z0-9] and cannot be empty. Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the SemVer sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be 1.0.0-alpha.1. Then if another build is needed, it would become 1.0.0-alpha.2, and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.
